## Notes

- Evidence pointers:
	- Primary user flows: “User Story 1–3” acceptance scenarios.
	- State machines: FR-016 ~ FR-024 (活動狀態)、FR-032 ~ FR-036（報名狀態/一致性）。
	- Visibility rules: FR-017 ~ FR-019, FR-025.
	- Measurable outcomes: SC-001 ~ SC-005.

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
